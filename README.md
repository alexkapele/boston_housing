## Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

### Description

In this project a decision tree regressor was trained and tested on data collected from houses in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts, with the aim of predicting their monetary value. The project is primarily focused on the evaluation of the performance and predictive power of the model. 

### Data

The modified Boston housing dataset used consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. It is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).

**Features**
1.  `RM`: average number of rooms per dwelling
2. `LSTAT`: percentage of population considered lower status
3. `PTRATIO`: pupil-teacher ratio by town

**Target Variable**
4. `MEDV`: median value of owner-occupied homes
